# wmc-vs-pupil-size
Rest state pupil size gives a significant measure of mental arousal, concentration level, activity in 
locus coeruleus, fluid intelligence, engagement in cognitive task related factors of human body. These all can be 
combined under one term known as working memory capacity. Working memory capacity also gives significant 
measure of schizophrenia and other intellectual disabilities in humans. Recent study have shown positive 
relationship between working memory capacity and rest state pupil size. So, the numerical measure of working 
memory capacity can calculated if the rest state pupil size is known. In the present work, machine learning with 
linear regression is used to calculate the working memory capacity of individual from the pupil diameter. Many 
researchers have found a raw numerical relationship between rest state pupil size and working memory capacity. 
In this work the optimized pattern of the rest state pupil size and working memory capacity are found using the 
data mining technique known as newton interpolation
